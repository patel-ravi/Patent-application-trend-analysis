# Patent-application-trend-analysis

This project attempts to analyze 45,000 patent applications using topic modeling and co-occurrence analysis. It was developed as an academic group project for the course 94-775 Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy (Spring 2022) at CMU.

Team members: Kumar Ashwarya, Seok Hyun Chang, Ryosuke Kurematsu, Ravikumar Patel, Ethan Winter

The code analyzes 45,000 patent applications using topic modeling and co-occurrence analysis to identify the most common topics in patent text data (unstructured) and categorize the patents.

This tool can help the policy makers to select patent topics based on policy goals and save time by classifying the patents based on the topics instead of manual processing.
